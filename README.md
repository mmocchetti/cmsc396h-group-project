In order to get the program weather_console.py working you need a few things:
1. a file named 'mysql_user_config' with the variables user, password, database, and host all equal to what you would use to log into your msql server
2. you need mysql-connector installed for your python
3. you need to have your mysql server running
4. you need to have python2.7.14 running

Then you can run the script by running the command
$ /path/to/python2.7.14/python /path/to/path/script/weather_console.py
if your on windows
$ /path/to/python2.7.14/python.exe /path/to/path/script/weather_console.py

Lastly, before you run weather_console.py you should run upload_data.py
